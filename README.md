#The Concerns of Health Equity and social economics class within the system
### The health care system is a big part of what keeps society separate. The lower class who struggles with income will have an increasingly more difficult time paying the medical bills and medication which in health care is significantly high. Therefore causing an impact on their mental and physical health. A time when the issues were more prominent was during Covid 19, people who are richer got better care and were able to take care of their bills versus those who took a financial toll after getting care.The wealthier people were likely to have the resources to better social distance and stock up on food after being hospitalized from covid. They were more likely to perform high skilled jobs that allow them to work from home. Low socioeconomic status individuals were unlikely to have the means to care for themselves financially.
